Project built with JQuery, JavaScript, API, Ajax and SessionStorage.

The top of the page contains several buttons, each with a different animal name. You can create a new animal button with the MAGIC button.

Clicking a button will display 10 images of the animal that can be both animated and stopped by clicking on the image.

The animal names the user inputed will be saved in session storage meaning that even if the page reloads there would be a button for the inputed animals. However, if the tab where the page is created is closed the buttons will be deleted.

I've included comments which should explain what most of the code is doing.
